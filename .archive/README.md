# Archive

This folder contains historical documentation that was useful during initial development but is no longer needed for daily work.

## Why These Are Archived

All these docs served their purpose but are now superseded by:
- [PROJECT_PLAN.md](../PROJECT_PLAN.md) - Current timeline and milestones
- [ISSUES_BACKLOG.md](../ISSUES_BACKLOG.md) - Detailed feature specs
- [ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATION.md](./ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATION.md) - Architecture review (reference only)

## When to Look Here

- Historical context on architectural decisions
- Reference for what was tried and abandoned
- Evidence of technical debt being paid down

For day-to-day work, use [PROJECT_PLAN.md](../PROJECT_PLAN.md) instead.
